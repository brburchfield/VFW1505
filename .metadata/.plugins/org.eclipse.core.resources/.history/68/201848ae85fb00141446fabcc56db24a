Considered as the greatest living artist in his lifetime, he has since been held as one of the greatest artists of all time."},
	{title: "Donatello", description: "Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi was an early Renaissance sculptor from Florence. He is, in part, known for his work in bas-relief, a form of shallow relief sculpture that, in Donatello's case, incorporated significant 15th-century developments in perspectival illusionism."},

Tallis served under four English Monarchs and was treated very well. Queen Elisabeth granted him and his pupil, William Boyd, exclusive rights to use England's printing press to publish music; a first of its time."},
	{title: "Josquin Des Prez", description: "Widely recognized by just his first name, Josquin Des Prez was Europe's most sought after musician during his lifetime. His popularity, no doubt, was a result of combining many contemporary styles of music, his originality, and his ability to unveil the meaning and emotions of a text through music."},
	{title: "Pierre de La Rue", description: "Pierre de La Rue wrote many styles of music, almost as much as Josquin. La Rue's repertoire consists entirely of vocal music. His style of voicing shows that he preferred low voices, often composing C's and B flats below the bass clef. His most popular work, the Requiem, and one of the earliest surviving Requiem masses, emphasizes the lower voices."},
	{title: "Claudio Monteverdi", description: "Linking the Renaissance to the Baroque, Claudio Monteverdi's revolutionary music included the first dramatic opera, Orfeo. Much of Monteverdi's early years were spent composing madrigals; nine books in total. These books clearly mark the change in thinking and compositional style between the two periods."}
